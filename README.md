The Awful Truth About Tetris
============================

What is that?
-------------

A little game inspired by some picture found on the Internet (http://www.flickr.com/photos/eduardosangil/5325189136/in/photostream).

Game is using awesome FlashPunk engine. Many thanks goes to the Chevy Ray for that great framework.


What about this source code ?
-----------------------------

Code is little bit messy, because I can't wait to start another pet project, and don't want to spend time cleaning this one.

Do whatever you want to do with this sources. Hope, someone will find it useful.
